# Projects
The raw code project is located in the folder ciphers, where there is a Python script named ciphers.py.
The helper code is contained in the same folder, a file named helper.py.

## How To Use:
### Running the raw code:
To run the raw code, download the file and run it. Then, call each of the individual functions to perform the encryption. The raw code is a useful module for importing into programs.
### Using the helper tool:
To use the helper tool (if you are not very familiar with Python), simply run helper.py, and the code will prompt you for whatever you need to do.
