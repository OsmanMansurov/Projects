# Projects
The raw code project is located in the Python code ciphers.py.
The helper code is contained in a file named helper.py
This file contains a large amount of different ciphers in cryptography

## How To Use:
### Running the raw code:
To run the raw code, download the file and run it. Then, call each of the individual functions to perform the encryption. The raw code is a useful module for importing into programs.
### Using the helper tool:
To use the helper tool (if you are not very familiar with Python), simply run helper.py, and the code will prompt you for whatever you need to do.
